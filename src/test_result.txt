ERROR in ./src/components/GameOverScreen.js 7:0-64
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './ConsciousnessTrendChart' in 'C:\Users\user\Desktop\historio\historio-web\src\components'
Did you mean 'ConsciousnessTrendChart.js'?
BREAKING CHANGE: The request './ConsciousnessTrendChart' failed to resolve only because it was resolved as fully specified
(probably because the origin is strict EcmaScript Module, e. g. a module with javascript mimetype, a '*.mjs' file, or a '*.js' file where the package.json contains '"type": "module"').
The extension in the request is mandatory for it to be fully specified.
Add the extension to the request.
